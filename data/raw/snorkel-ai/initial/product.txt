In the new world of off-the-shelf generative AI models, you can just grab a model pre-trained by OpenAI, Google, Hugging Face, etc., and start generating predictions. And these predictions can be large chunks of generated content! This leaves many data scientists wondering, where does my data actually add value in the development of production AI healthcare applications? In this webinar, you’ll learn how your unique data is critical to developing high-quality generative AI applications and learn where your data can be used and how it should be prepared, managed, and applied to deliver real-world value for your organization. You’ll learn How to accelerate GenAI projects, a data-centric approach to AI development How to evaluate generative AI applications Why LLMs need to be adapted and customized to deliver mission-critical enterprise AI Why data development is the key interface to building custom AI Presented by Nazanin Makkinejad Applied Machine Learning Engineer Snorkel AI Nazanin Makkinejad is an applied machine learning engineer at Snorkel AI, where she works with enterprise data science teams to realize the benefits of data-centric AI and Snorkel Flow. Prior to her role at Snorkel AI, Nazanin was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), working on the intersection of deep learning and brain image analysis. She has a Ph.D. from the Illinois Institute of Technology in Biomedical & Medical Engineering and a Master’s Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Illinois Chicago.
