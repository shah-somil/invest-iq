Customer First Always start with the end user in mindâevery time. At the end of the day, we are nothing without our customers. Every decision we make, every line of code we write, must answer one question: How does this benefit the customer? Rational Create value. State facts. Use logic. Avoid embellishment. Minimize emotion. We prioritize rationality in decision-makingâaim before firing, measure before cutting, and think before acting. Minimalists Simplicity is elegant. Simplicity is timeless. Simplicity is scalable. Every time weâve made things simpler, weâve made them better. From our direct mail flow to our marketing experiments. We spend hours removing a single char. Fast Decide fast. Learn fast. Speed isnât the enemy of qualityâitâs the path to it. Every day, we aim to move faster than the day before. Fundamentalist To invent anything, we believe in digging deep into systems, laws, and code of what has been done in the past. Only after we deeply understand the past can we invent new ways of making them better.
