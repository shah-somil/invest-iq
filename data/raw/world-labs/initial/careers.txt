About | World Labs About Us World Labs is a leading spatial intelligence company, building frontier world models that can perceive, generate, reason, and interact with the 3D world. World Labs is a frontier AI research and product company. We build foundational world models that can perceive, generate, reason, and interact with the 3D world — unlocking AI's full potential through spatial intelligence by transforming seeing into doing, perceiving into reasoning, and imagining into creating. We believe spatial intelligence will unlock new forms of storytelling, creativity, design, simulation, and immersive experiences across both virtual and physical worlds. World Labs was founded by visionary AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li along with Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall, each a world-renowned technologist in machine learning, generative AI, computer vision, and graphics. We bring together a world-class team, united by a shared curiosity, passion, and deep backgrounds in technology — from AI research to systems engineering to product design — creating a tight feedback loop between our cutting-edge research and products that empower our users. Our first product, Marble, is powered by best-in-class generative 3D world models and enables anyone to create spatially cohesive, high-fidelity, and persistent 3D worlds from just a single image, video or text prompt.
