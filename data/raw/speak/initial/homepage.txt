Â If you are looking to study or review or learn, this is an option, in addition to having a virtual tutor or a guide is made and the truth is excellent ð10/10 mingorr81, 06/24/25 Better than anything else I took Spanish classes for seven years, I used Duolingo, I used Pimsleur, and others...yet I still struggled to speak and understand. this app is like having a personal tutor, without the anxiety of an actual person, judging your skills... This is the best language app Iâve ever used. User review, 07/21/23 Amazing!!! While other services just correct awkward sentences, I was surprised that Speak provides detailed feedback on 'why' the expression is awkward User Review, 06/04/24 If I knew now, what I knew them This app has the potential to be the best language learning app to date. Far surpasses, Babbel and Rosetta Stone. I will definitely be getting the premium package. Delano Holloway, 04/16/25 This works! Within the first few minutes I was like hell yea Duo can KMA this is real learning. If I didn't have work in the morning I'd be on it at least another 2 hours. Bob White, 06/06/25 Easily the most effective Spanish app I've used This is the only language app that doesn't leave you behind. So many other teach you something, review, then move on. This one makes sure you're actually picking up the concepts. Tried it for a week and then happily signed up, worth every penny Eugene Haight, 06/14/23 I can actually learn to have a conversation I've always wanted to speak French but I figured I was too old to learn now, but in just 2 days I've picked up several sentences and I'm enjoying learning with this program. It's not overwhelming me. blair lee, 08/09/24 This is godly!! I've tried various things to live a 'godly life,' but it always ended in a three-day wonder. Speak is the precious app that broke that cycle! I'm amazed at myself for muttering the sentences I learned! Patrick King, 11/10/24 I NEED MORE!! I hope they release it in other languages because I like it so much! Especially since it's AI and free-talking, it feels more confident and correct than talking to a real person! Vera James, 05/29/25 awesome!!!!! at this rate I'll be learning Spanish in no time this app is amazing for beginners love it! Frequently Asked Questions How do I get started?
