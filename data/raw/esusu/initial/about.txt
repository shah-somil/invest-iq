Too many stand at the edge of possibility, held back by systems that judge without truly seeing them. We use data as a tool for liberation, helping people move past barriers that limit opportunity and reduce human worth to numbers. Our Clarion Call is to make the impossible possible for those shut out or left behind, to open long-closed doors, to challenge the forces that diminish people, and to build a world where dignity is recognized as a birthright. We are here to create a more perfect financial system. Mission Dismantle barriers to housing for working families Vision Unleash The Power of data to bridge the racial wealth gap Unlock Your Credit Score with Esusu Watch Video Founder Story Wemimo Abbey and Samir Goel founded Esusu in 2018 to confront a simple truth: the gap between the wealthy and the poor in America is wider than it has been in decades, even as the cost of living keeps rising. Today, about 67% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and nearly 30% of lower-income households spend 95% or more of their income on basic necessities like housing, food and utilities. With prices climbing faster than wages, too many people work hard yet fall further behind. Esusu was created as an economic mobility platform to help people build credit, strengthen stability and access life-changing opportunities, guided by the belief that where you come from, what you look like and your financial identity should never determine where you end up in life.
