Working with video and images is hard. We make it simple. Itâs expensive, time consuming, and downright maddening to develop apps based on video and images. And multimodal foundation models only get you to square 1. Thatâs why thereâs Coactive. Powerful and flexible We built a complete stack, so that you donât have to. Easily find the perfect moment, automatically create robust and specific metadata, and easily understand whatâs in your content library. High efficiency, low TCO Our optimized platform handles massive scale at speed. Reusable embeddings minimize long-term compute and storage costs. Future-proof Youâre not locked in to any one foundation model. Choose the right model for your needs, and chain models for deeper understanding. Multimodal AI Platform (MAP) Coactive provides a single place to manage and activate content catalogs across image, video, and audio. The platform handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on building your appâs product logic and iterating. Ingestion at scale Handle massive volumes of mediaâone customer was able to ingest up to 2,000 video hours per hour while reducing costs by 30â60% compared to traditional pipelines.* Intelligent pre-processing, for context-aware analysis and easy re-use Coactive segments video into shots and audio intervalsâlaying the groundwork for rich, semantic tagging and search capabilities. No reprocessing needed, content stays reusable, searchable, and ready for evolving workflows. Best-of-breed foundation models Use Coactiveâs open model catalog, or plug in models via Bedrock, Azure AI, or Databricks. Chain models for deeper insights. Fine tuning Custom fit to your domain needs with fine-tuning thatâs decoupled, evaluable, and built for iteration. Search and discovery Turn unstructured video, image, and audio into rich, time-aligned, searchable contentâso you can find exactly what matters, fast. Automatically tag content across video and audio assets Robust, specific tagging that can power ad targeting, content customization, personalization, and more. *Based on an actual customer experience. Ingestion performance is dependent on specific conditions, and your experience may vary. Fast ingestion at scale. Smart, too. Handle massive volumes of media with automatic chunking into meaningful segments, embedding, and lineage tracking for trust, and reproducibility. High-throughput media processing Ingest petabytes of video and images across cloud or on-prem storage. Coactive is architected to handle large-scale, concurrent processing with minimal bottlenecks. Smart chunking for long-form content Automatically splits video and audio into meaningful segments (shots and dialogue intervals) to enable precise analysis without overloading compute. Go beyond shot detection for better contextual awareness Unlike other platforms that stop at just marking shot boundaries, Coactive enables context-aware analysis across segments. Built-in lineage tracing Every asset and transformation is traceableâdown to the version of each model used. This ensures consistent outputs across iterations and full auditability. Pick your foundation model winner Coactive lets you pick from a broad portfolio of multimodal foundation models, so you can use the best one for your needs. Chain models for deeper insights. Open catalog, ready to use Access a growing library of hosted open-source and proprietary models, all pre-integrated and ready for deployment. Bring your own models (BYOM) Integrate your preferred closed or fine-tuned models through frameworks like AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, and Databricks. Maintain full control over what runs where. Composable model chains Design flexible inference pathways by chaining models together. For example, run lightweight captioning first, then escalate to deeper multimodal analysis only when needed. Find the right asset, quickly and accurately Coactive turns unstructured video, image, and audio into rich, time-aligned, searchable contentâso you can find exactly what matters, fast. Search across all assets With a unified semantic search layer, you can search across all assetsâwhether tagged by lightweight captioning models or deeper multimodal pipelinesâthrough a single, consistent API. Get specific. Really specific Query visual, audio, and transcript signals simultaneously to locate specific moments, patterns, or concepts. Results are time-aligned and traceable back to source assets. Ask questions in natural language or in SQL Support both natural language and structured SQL-style queries to power editorial tools, creative review workflows, and automated routing systems. Learn more about content discovery with Coactive. Get robust metadata in minutes Turn visual and audio content into structured metadataâautomatically and at scale. Flexible tagging with Dynamic Tags Tag assets using natural language prompts with frame- to video-level precision. Start with zero-shot, refine with examplesâno model training required. Multimodal metadata, unified taxonomy Extract objects, scenes, dialogue, and segments across video, image, and audioâall aligned to your custom metadata structure. Built for scale and integration Query results via SQL or API. Coactiveâs model-agnostic architecture integrates with your stack and separates metadata from embeddings for faster, cheaper performance. The Smart, Layered Approach to Content Intelligence Architecture Modular architecture enables selective model execution, embedding reuse, and path optimization Closed system lacks extensibility, modularity, and flexibility Vendor Flexibility No lock-in â swap, upgrade, or bring your own foundation model Locked-in with no portability, no choice Model Updates Skip 2/3rds of reprocessing steps, saving time and processing cost Must reprocess all data from the beginning with each update Performance & Cost Efficiency High throughput ingestion. Reuse embeddings, no duplicate ingestion or compute = Lower TCO Higher TCO from mandatory end-to-end foundation model inference, even for low-complexity tasks Media Use â¨Case Fit Built for content supply chains, ads, trust Not tailored for enterprise media and advertising needs Time to Value Time to Value Slower onboarding, high customization needs Future-Proof Choice of models and upgrade-ready Bound to vendorâs foundation model evolution Approach Foundation Model Only Resources Events Unleash your video and image content: Accelerate content workflows with Coactive MAP â25 Featured Maximizing Content in the AI Era Featured Coactive for Media & Entertainment
