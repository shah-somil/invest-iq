About us | Mistral AI Frontier AI. For all of us. We exist to make frontier AI accessible to everyone. We believe in a future where AI is abundant and accessible. We aspire to empower the world to build with—and benefit from—the most significant technology of our time. We are Mistral AI, a pioneering French artificial intelligence startup founded in April 2023 by three visionary researchers: Arthur Mensch, Guillaume Lample, and Timothée Lacroix. United by their shared academic roots at École Polytechnique and experiences at Google DeepMind and Meta, they envisioned a different, audacious approach to artificial intelligence—to challenge the opaque-box nature of ‘big AI’, and making this cutting-edge technology accessible to all. This manifested into the company’s mission of democratizing artificial intelligence through open-source, efficient, and innovative AI models, products, and solutions. 200+ 200+ Team members Team members 15 15 Different nationalities Different nationalities 50% 50 % Female leaders Female leaders Latest updates.
