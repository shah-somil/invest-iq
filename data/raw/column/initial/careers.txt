But be ready for it to be a bit weird... All Column employees subject to duplication. Join at your own risk. If you've made it here you probably want to know what we're hiring for and if you should apply. You've made it to the right place. However, a couple things to note. First, we're not your normal tech company and we're definitely not your normal bank. You should read through this site in detail before you apply (especially the company page) and about our funding and our hiring philosophy. In short, we're a pretty small team and we plan on staying that way. We are hiring a few people so we're excited to talk but it may be a different process than you're used to. We heavily emphasize employee experience, and a big part of that means not burdening them with constant interviews. So part of our process is async (things like a take-home) and that can sometimes result in a less than ideal candidate experience. That's a tradeoff we're willing to make, and means once you work here there is more deep work time and fewer distractions. If this sounds like something you'd be into â let's go do this thing! Open roles Software Engineer (Backend) Weâre a lean and experienced team of nine engineers, and weâre seeking a talented Backend engineer to join us. We write mostly Go, but experience there isnât that important. We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience with a strongly typed back-end language on a high-caliber team. This role reports directly to our Founder/CEO and will work alongside our team in-person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco 3+ days a week. Please apply here Software Engineer (Infrastructure) We're a lean and experienced team. We like our current size of nine engineers. For an excellent candidate we're open to hiring one or two more. We write mostly Go, but experience there isn't that important....it's a pretty easy language to learn. We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high caliber and high velocity team. We'll require a take-home that does take time, so if that's a non-starter for you we're sorry. We find it the best way for you to show your skills, without being overly burdensome on the team! Please apply here Software Engineer (Full-Stack) Column is looking for a full-stack product engineer to build high-quality, intuitive banking user experiences. We're a lean and experienced team of nine, and want to grow thoughtfully with exceptional people. In this role you will be writing Go, React, and SQL, and working on our customer dashboard. We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high-caliber and high-velocity team. This role reports directly to our Founder/CEO and will work alongside our team in-person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco 3+ days a week. Please apply here Data Analytics Engineer As Columnâs first Data Analytics Engineer, youâll help build the foundation for how we use data to operate, monitor, and grow our business. Youâll be responsible for modeling and maintaining our core datasets, building trusted dashboards, tooling, and enabling fast, accurate analysis across our teams. Youâll partner closely with engineering, operations, compliance, and risk to ensure we have reliable, accessible reporting for everything from internal decision-making to regulatory requirements. This is a high-ownership role for someone who gets excited about building clean, auditable data products and workflows, in a highly regulated space, and who wants to have outsized impact on a small, high-performing team. This role reports directly to our CEO as a member of our engineering team, and is an in-person role located in our Presidio-based, San Francisco office (3-4 days/week) - we will support relocation for the right candidate. Please apply here Emerging Markets Lead As Columnâs Emerging Markets Lead, you will serve as the leader for one of our most strategic international expansion initiatives. In this role, you will be responsible for driving 0-to-1 growth for a new banking product, with a particular focus on building and nurturing relationships with prospective partners and customers in select markets on the African continent, with the potential to expand into Asian, and European markets as well. This role combines global expansion strategy, business development with hands-on relationship management, requiring a general business athlete who thrives on networking and executing complex partnerships. This is a unique opportunity to be on the founding team for a new business line, with significant autonomy and direct impact on Columnâs global expansion strategy. This position has the flexibility to be based in Dubai or a key international financial hub (location flexible based on candidate and market priorities), with regular travel throughout the region and quarterly travel to Columnâs headquarters in San Francisco. Please apply here Business Operations As a founding member of Columnâs Business Operations team, you will be responsible for helping lay the foundation for the companyâs next decade of growth. This team will own Columnâs most important strategic and operational initiatives, with a heavy focus on designing new operating systems that will directly impact our ability to scale. Individuals in this role will serve as the âGMâ of a particular product or project, diving deep into a wide range of challenges across product strategy, pricing optimization, compliance operations, and internal tool/platform development. You will have the opportunity to experience having P&L ownership of a particular product, while working alongside senior leadership at Column to take our business to the next level. This position will report to our CEO, and will be in-person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco (3-4 days/week) - we will support relocation for the right candidate. Please apply here Strategic Partnerships Lead As a Strategic Partnerships Lead at Column, your mandate is to build relationships with and sell into strategic accounts. Youâll collaborate with leadership and Column's Business team to identify and close opportunities with companies that would benefit from building financial products with Columnâs APIs - demonstrating Columnâs value proposition and differentiation every step of the way. Success in this role looks like positioning yourself as a trusted advisor to current and future customers, building long-term relationships with prospects, and ultimately structuring and winning deals with our most important accounts. This role reports to the Head of Sales & Partnerships and is in our San Francisco HQ or eligible for remote, with travel to clients and prospects expected. Please apply here Sales & Partnerships - New Business As part of the New Business team within Columnâs Go-To-Market organization, your mandate is to identify, engage, and qualify new prospective partnerships that drive revenue for Column. Youâll work closely with Sales & Partnerships colleagues to drive relationships with sophisticated companies, from stealth startups to innovative public companies. This is not your typical SDR role. Weâre looking for a sharp, analytical operator who thrives on digging into industries, direct outreach, and gleaning insights from conversations. Youâll conduct market research, source and qualify leads, and play a critical role in building our GTM motion from the ground up. This role reports to our Head of Sales & Partnerships and is based in our Presidio office in SF. Please apply here Growth As one of the first members of the Growth team, youâll be responsible for building and overseeing all aspects of our customer management while acting as a trusted partner, advisor and advocate for a wide variety of customers. You will also be in charge of designing and implementing the strategy, processes, and content needed to help us scale this key function. Column's Growth team is not your typical Customer Success or Account Management team in that Column is a critical, often existential, partner for our customers, our customer relationships are deeply collaborative and complex, and each customer contributes meaningfully to our revenue. This role is highly cross-functional and collaborative, partnering closely with Columnâs Executive, Solutions Engineering, Sales, Compliance, and Product teams to ensure a top-notch customer experience. Youâll also represent the voice of the customer to help inform Column's strategy, including the product roadmap, go-to-market motions and more. Success in this role also means becoming an expert on the Financial Technology space and on how companies partner with Column (our customers include many key industry players such as Brex and Carta). This role reports to the Head of Go-To-Market and is an in-person role, where youâll be expected to work out of our San Francisco Presidio-based office 3+ days a week. Please apply here Commercial Counsel Column is growing its in-house commercial legal team to own the legal infrastructure behind our most important commercial and strategic relationships. This isn't your typical in-house Commercial Counsel role reviewing SaaS contracts - you'll architect novel partnership structures that enable modern banking experiences, navigating complex regulatory requirements along the way. You'll work closely with Column's Sales & Partnerships, Risk, and Compliance teams to define how we structure our deals, serve our customers, and scale our platform safely. If you're interested in combining legal acumen with a builder's mindset - and want you work to have a direct impact on how financial services are delivered at scale - we think you'll be excited about this role! This is an in-person role with 3-4 days per week expected in our Presidio-based San Francisco office. Please apply here Product Counsel As a senior Product Counsel, you will be responsible for providing strategic counsel for Columnâs product offerings, both existing and new. This isn't a role where you'll be stuck in the background â you'll be a key strategic partner working directly with our Go-to-Market, Engineering, Compliance, Risk, and Finance teams to drive product development and expansion. Your unique perspective, drawn from past experience in traditional banking, fintech, and/or highly regulated product launches, will be invaluable as we navigate complex regulatory environments while maintaining our competitive edge. Unlike typical in-house counsel positions where you might be one of many lawyers reviewing decisions made by others, this role offers true ownership. You'll be the key decision-maker on product legal strategy, with direct access to leadership and the ability to shape our approach to regulatory compliance and product development as we launch new fintech partnerships and expand our existing offerings. In connection with these launches, you will also work closely with our fintech partners to innovate and launch products, making this a hands-on and customer-facing role. This is an opportunity to combine your BigLaw training, banking knowledge, and fintech experience to create something meaningful. If you're ready to become a builder, we should talk. This role reports directly to the Bankâs General Counsel and is based in San Francisco, CA. Please apply here Customer Risk Strategy Weâre looking for an exceptional all-around business athlete to join our Customer Risk Strategy team! You donât need to be an expert in banking or risk on day one - we are seeking a self-motivated candidate who is excited about disrupting financial services and willing to utilize their highly strategic, operational, and product-oriented mindset to help drive continuous improvements across our existing operations. Your work will help Column deepen its relationships with its Fintech Partners by effectively managing our forward-thinking, strategic, and highly efficient risk programs (a critical differentiator for Column!) to ensure we scale safely. This is a unique entry point into the world of risk at a high-growth fintech company, where youâll gain skills and experience that few others can offer. This role will report directly to our Head of Regulatory Affairs and will partner closely with leaders across engineering, business, legal, compliance, operations, and go-to-market teams. This role is based in-person at our Presidio office in San Francisco (3-4 days/week). Please apply here Talent Partner As a Talent Partner at Column, you will play a pivotal role in fueling the company's growth by identifying, attracting, and hiring top-tier talent. In this position, you'll own the entire hiring process, partnering closely with Column's leadership team and key stakeholders to understand their business needs, while designing and executing a strategic approach to recruiting. You'll lead full-cycle recruiting for a diverse range of roles, including highly specialized and leadership positions, ensuring a seamless and exceptional candidate experience along the way. This is an exciting opportunity for a seasoned recruiter who is passionate about building high-performance teams and enjoys the challenge of niche and bespoke searches. You will also have the opportunity to help shape and evolve our recruiting processes as we scale. This role reports directly to the Head of People, and is an in-person position where you'll be expected to work out of our Presidio-based office in San Francisco 3+ days a week. Please apply here AML Advisory World-class AML compliance doesn't slow business down at Columnâit makes business possible. Our AML Advisory position sits at the intersection of customer engagement, product innovation, and regulatory excellence. In this role, you will partner directly with sales and growth teams in addition to the compliance function. You will decode customer behaviors, evaluate prospect relationships, follow the money through funds flows, and examine evolving use cases in real-time and have direct exposure to regulators, novel customer types, and first-of-their-kind product flows. This is your chance to do meaningful, complex work in an environment that actually builds things. You will shape how we think about risk, guide our due diligence practices, and influence our controls with a sharp eye on both emerging threats, industry best practices and regulatory expectations. If you thrive on novel problem-solving, want fewer layers between you and impact, and believe financial infrastructure can both be secure and scaleable, we canât wait to speak with you. This role is based out of our San Francisco headquarters. Please apply here Customer Due Diligence The Customer Due Diligence role is responsible for the execution of Column's KYC program, inclusive of CIP, CDD, and EDD. This individual will own onboarding and periodic reviews for the Bank's high-risk customers, as well as enhancing Column's KYC program, procedures, and controls so that they remain best-in-class. This role will also work closely with Compliance stakeholders in performing the AML components of due diligence for the Bank's fintech partnerships. This role will report into the Bank's first line. While an in-person presence in the Bankâs Presidio-based office is strongly preferred, this role is open to remote applicants with the expectation of periodic travel. Please apply here Partner Diligence The Partner Diligence team leverages deep regulatory compliance expertise to manage the diligence, risk assessment, control review, approval, and onboarding of Columnâs FinTech partners. The regulatory landscape for fintech-banking partnerships is evolving daily, and Column is committed to exceeding regulatory expectations when it comes to partner onboarding. As such, weâre looking for someone who not only has a deep command of federal and state financial regulations, but also understands how to identify, assess, and mitigate the compliance risks posed by both consumer and commercial partnerships. Implementation of a best-in-class Third-Party Risk Management program is critical to the success of Columnâs business model and growth of its partnership business, and the individual in this Partner Diligence role will have an opportunity to meaningfully influence the Bankâs strategic direction, growth, safety & soundness, and success. This position will report to the Bankâs General Counsel, our Chief Risk Officer. There is a strong preference for this role to be in-person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco, however we may consider remote candidates with frequent travel to San Francisco. Please apply here Crypto Compliance Weâre hiring for a Crypto Compliance role to architect and own Columnâs compliance framework for its crypto products from the ground up. The GENIUS Act has created the first federal framework for stablecoins, and we need someone who can translate complex, evolving regulations into practical systems that protect the bank while enabling innovation. This isn't a box-checking compliance role. We need a builder who understands that compliance done right is a competitive advantage â it unlocks partnerships, accelerates product velocity, and builds trust with regulators. You'll work directly with our product, engineering, and risk teams to build systems that scale, not just policies that look good on paper. This position will report directly to the Bankâs Chief Compliance Officer, and the individual in the role must be willing to work in person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco (3-4 days/week). Please apply here Payment Operations (New Grad) Weâre hiring for a member of our Payment Ops team. In this role youâll own processes, customer service for related cases, and scalability for a best in class payments function at a technology forward bank. This is an excellent opportunity for someone whoâs looking to dive into strategy, developing processes, and true operations ownership. Bonus points if youâre interested in, or have experience with payments at a financial institution or fintech. This role reports directly to the Head of Solutions Engineering and will work alongside our team in-person in our Presidio-based office in San Francisco 3+ days a week. Please apply here I don't fit into any of these roles! You get Column and you think you can drive value on day one. We'll be honest the bar will be pretty high for us to hire outside of these roles - but surprise us. Give us a compelling narrative and hustle....and we promise we'll read the email! Please apply here We're mostly hiring locally in the San Francisco Bay Area, however will be open to remote for exceptional candidates. Sadly we won't have the time to respond to everyone, but we do read every application we get. Please go through the application links, direct emails are strongly discouraged :) Notice to Recruiters & Staffing Agencies Products ACH Wire Realtime Book Transfers Checks Bank Accounts Loan Origination Loan Purchase Card Programs Debt Financing Developers Documentation Changelog Company About Blog Careers Press Security Privacy Notice Column N.A.
