Hi, Iâm landing in NYC at around 9pm this evening and need a hotel near Union Square. I want to book with points. Certainly â we have two hotels near Union Square. How long will you be staying? 2 nights The first one is a 5 minute walk away and I can get you a room with a King Bed for 26,000 points a night. The second one is a 9 minute walk away and I can get you a room with a King Bed for 23,000 points a night. Which one do you prefer? Letâs go with the 2nd one. Iâve just made a reservation for two nights! Iâve just texted you the details. You may check in anytime today after 4pm. Your remaining points balance is 173,405. Hope you enjoy your stay! Is there anything else I can help you with? Does this hotel have breakfast? Breakfast is served on the 2nd floor every day from 7am to 10am. Appreciate it! Happy to help. Have a safe flight!

Janelle Sallenave Chief Experience Officer at Chime 70% resolution across chat and voice Read the case study "Rippling has a very broad surface area with distinct products that require unique treatments â we brought this problem statement to Decagon and they delivered. We are able to tailor the experience and responses to customers to not only deliver strong deflection results, but also enhance the customer experience along the way. We are very happy with our results and are looking forward to partnering further with Decagon." Husam Najib VP, Customer Support 32% increase in deflection Read the case study âThough we already had a robust Voice of the Customer program and an understanding of customer inquiries we thought we could deflect, we saw 10x higher deflection at launch than we anticipated. And while ticket deflection was our primary goal, Decagon has also allowed us to scale our Chat program to 24/7 while hitting critical CX metrics (e.g., FRT, CSAT) at the same time.â Sarah Vanden Broek Director, CX Operations Strategy and AI Director 95% cost reduction Read the case study Agent Operating Procedures (AOPs) No more rigid systems that require slow and costly professional services to build and maintain. Use natural language instructions that compile into code to dynamically handle complex, real-world situations. Learn more The best of both AOPs combine the power and flexibility of natural language instructions with the precision and rigor of code to reliably scale AI agents. Natural language instructions CX operators quickly architect and iterate on AI logic, similar to how theyâd teach humans Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Control over core code Technical teams retain control over guardrail enforcement and connections with internal systems to pull data or take action.
