Clay helps go-to-market teams up level their data enrichment and automate personalized outreach. You can start with a list of leads, either prospected through Clay or from your own CRM, and follow the steps below. Step 1: Basic Data Enrichment & Cleaning Clay combines 75+ data enrichment tools into one marketplace, resulting in superior data coverage and qualityâon anything from contact information to company firmographics. Our customers have tripled data coverage vs. providers like Zoominfo while cutting costs by a magnitude of ten or twenty. Step 2: AI Data Enrichment We enable you to use AI to do research that previously required manual SDR work, including reading and analyzing webpages, PDFs, and Google searches for specific information. Step 3: Automated Outreach Once youâve nailed your data enrichment, you can use AI to craft relevant, compelling messaging based on that data. Everything syncs back to your CRM, allowing your team to go from campaign idea to execution in seconds. What kinds of companies uses Clay? We serve GTM teams of all sizes, ranging from large enterprise companies to SMBs, startups, solo founders, outbound agencies, and more. We have thousands of users and hundreds of paying customers, including Ramp, Pave, Verkada, and more. Who on my team should use Clay? Here are a few typically successful team setups weâve seen with Clay. At enterprise companies: GTM leaders decide the criteria for lead enrichment, segmentation, and outreach A GTM operations team member implements the above criteria into Clay. (Clay is the teamâs âenrichment layer,â which syncs to the CRM to keep data live and accurate). SDRs do not interface directly with Clay. Instead, they benefit from already-curated leads, enriched data, personalizations in their CRMs. For example, one clientâs SDRs simply click a button in Salesforce to fetch enriched data from Clay, including relevant a company summary, relevant contacts, and a draft message. At startups, a growth lead often implements Clay and runs all of the companyâs outreach single-handedly. Once the company reaches some level of volume, these startups hire a sales team member to help with live conversations. At outbound agencies, one founder often sets up and runs Clay campaigns on behalf of many clients. What tools does Clay replace for me? Clay can replace your prospecting, data enrichment, and AI message drafting tools. We donât replace email sending tools or CRMs (we integrate with them!) Many people run successful campaigns using just Clay, an email sending tool, and a CRM. You can continue to use any tools you have subscriptions to in Clay. â What common use cases can I accomplish in Clay? Build lists from CSVs or 10+ prospecting sources including free access to companies, people, and open jobs data. Enrich data with 100+ enrichment tools for superior data quality and coverage as compared to relying on just one tool. Use AI to scrape websites, do unstructured research that previously required SDRs, and draft messages . Teams commonly also use Clay to automate outbound lead generation campaigns, CRM enrichment, inbound lead scoring and outreach, and more. What does Clay change about my current process? Traditional outbound sales meant people spending a lot of manual effort on bad research and generic, spammy emails that donât land new customers. By enabling new levels of deep research, targeting, and messaging, Clay helps businesses quickly find and message their ideal customers. We save teams immense amounts of time and money in the service of helping them grow. How does Clay impact the conversation about stricter spam limits? There are more APIs and data enrichment tools than ever before and more SaaS companies selling to other SaaS companies as well. This means outbound email is becoming harder, spam filters are getting better, and the need to be ultra-specific and personalized is now super important otherwise you will get banned. Clay helps companies find the right customers and message them at the right time, which means sending a smaller number of highly targeted emails rather than large blasts of generic, spammy messages. Clay helps companies avoid spam filters by actually sending relevant, compelling emails. This is better for companies and better for customers. Why hasnât anyone done this yet? We have different beliefs than people who are building enrichment tools No data set will be complete You should be able to clean the data and get the data in the same place to simplify the workflow We believe that by opening up different ways of prospecting, there will be creative techniques to find companies rather than one prescribed approach. How much does it cost? Our paid plans start at $149/mo. Our free trial that gives you access to our Pro Plan ($800/mo value) for 14 days, with 1000 credits. We also have a free plan. See more details on our pricing page . How does Clay impact my SDR workflow? No. Clay reduces the amount of manual grunt work that SDRs have to do and allows them to focus on nurturing and closing deals through cold calls, personal follow-ups, real sales conversations, and more.
