Go to current openings Our values We believe that making business accessible and understandable will lead to smarter decision-making, better-aligned teams, and a greater sense of purpose for everyone. Our mission is to make this a reality at every company. Give a shit Giving a shit can't be taught. It's an inner drive that compels you to do what's right and do it well. Have passion, take pride, and care deeply about your impact. Create clarity Cut through ambiguity and reveal the truth. Start with why, then answer how and what. Treat problems like puzzles, dig deeper, and find the right path. Build trust With trust, it's safe to take risks. We get there by being open, honest, and accountable. Actively listen, speak your mind, and consistently show up. Raise the bar Scrap the status quo and push yourself to create something that wows. Get others excited to do the same. Iterate, elevate, and don't stop moving forward.

You can choose to work remotely full-time, meet up with colleagues in your area, or travel to a hub every so often, on us. We currently don't require employees to come into any office. We benefit from the focus and flexibility of remote work and the energy and creativity that comes from collaborating in-person.
