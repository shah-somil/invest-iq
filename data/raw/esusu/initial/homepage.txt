We also immediately decided to offer this service to our residents instead of charging them for it. This is a small contribution on our side to help our residents improve their financial situation, and we found this is a nice way to give them something back.â Patrick Richard Founder & CEO, Stoneweg US âOnce we started to see our ESG reporting come back from Esusu, it was clear the effects rent reporting could have on the portion of the US population that are renters, particularly low-income renters.â Jeffrey Brodsky Vice Chairman, Related Companies âIn Esusu, we found a service that improves resident credit scores, often a significant barrier to renting an apartment, buying a car or home,â said Zabriskie. âOur residents, by making on-time rental payments, can build a healthier financial future.â Joanna Zabriskie CEO & President at BH. âWe work hard every day to provide an exceptional experience for our residents by offering high-quality homes, excellent service, and amenities that make their lives easier, and this partnership with Esusu extends our commitment to enhancing our residentsâ financial well-being.â Dallas Tanner CEO of Invitation Homes Weâre proud to be the rent reporting provider for some of the biggest names in real estate: Esusu By The Numbers Powering financial mobility at scale, unlocking billions and supporting millions. $ 0 M Capital raised $ 0 B Economic value 0 M Renters impacted 0 M Rental units Outcomes You Can Count On Rent Reporting âI have been using Esusu for under a year.
