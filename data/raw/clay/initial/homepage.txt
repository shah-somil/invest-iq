Previous Next "In my professional opinion, Clay has one of the most practical and exciting applications of AI, in a decades-old practice that has long been stale." Keith Jones GTM Systems Lead "Clay should be an essential pillar of every company's GTM stack, enabling outbound built on the highest quality data foundation possible. Now you can automate hours of manual research so sales teams can focus on selling." Stevie Case CRO "This job has always been about creativity, despite how it might seem, and Clay enables me to answer more 'what if we could...' questions from our GTM teams than I ever could before." Alexander DeMoulin Director of Revenue Operations I love using and working with Clay.com because its extensive customization options allow it to seamlessly integrate into various systems, making it an essential part of our tech stack. Their hands-on customer support ensures we build out flows in the most efficient way possible, enhancing our overall productivity and effectiveness. David Bulmer Sales Ops "Clay is a game changer for marketing, data, and operations. We have tripled our enrichment rate with Clayâs combination of data providers vs. our previous solution. We're using the best aggregate results across a waterfall of data sources, and implementing complex workflow logic even beyond enrichmentâof course powered by AI. Clay makes it easy to use AI for GTM initiatives, unlocking new workflows that were infeasible before." Adam Wall Head of Sales Operations "Clay is a central part of our outbound campaign program. Itâs helped us fully automate lead enrichment that previously required expensive and time consuming manual research. We can use the hours we've saved on manual work for more interesting, creative, and important tasks, like coming up with new outreach ideas or nurturing relationships with prospects." Davide Grieco Director of Growth "Clay saves us hours a week that we previously spent researching and vetting companies that applied to our startup program. Our auto-approval rate has jumped to ~40%âwith no manual work needed." Josh Kim Head of Growth Programs "Scaling inefficient SDR work isnât possible without an infinite flow of capital. Clay helps automate mundane tasks like contact data enrichment, including pulling signals and triggers, so SDRs can focus their time on prioritized selling and spend their days more effectively. It evolves the SDR role and aligns it with better with marketing paths for more upward career momentum." Kris Rudegraap CEO "Not having Clay would hugely reduce our ability to run good outbound campaigns. We wouldnât be calling people as much, because itâs hard to get good phone numbers. We wouldnât be emailing as much, because weâd be likely to bounce or go to spam. With Clay, we have a reliable source of data enrichment and can run dynamic, multi-touch outreach sequences." Julien Reiman Head of Sales "Clay is the Rippling marketing team's secret weapon. It has helped us build an experimentation-driven GTM motion that iterates on ideas and scales what works. We've greatly improved our outbound email performance, deeply enriched our customer base with AI, and more." Ryan Narod VP, Corporate and Integrated Marketing
