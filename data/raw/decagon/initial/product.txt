The Decagon difference Instead of relying on the same professional services-reliant approach as the rest of the industry, Decagon delivers a product-driven approach to building, optimizing, and scaling Al agents. Agent Operating Procedures (AOPs) combine the power and flexibility of natural language with the precision and rigor of coded logic. Non-technical users can quickly create and iterate on Al agent logic, while technical teams retain control over the core code to enforce guardrails, integrate with internal systems, and fine-tune behavior. The rest of the industry The rest of the industry relies on coded workflows, decision trees, and developer SDKs. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Decagon way AOPs are natural language instructions that compile into code to dynamically handle complex, real-world situations. Your browser does not support the video tag.

AOPs 00 Define custom business logic for Al agents with natural language. Non- technical users can quickly create and iterate, while technical teams retain control over the core code to enforce guardrails, integrate with internal systems, and fine-tune behavior. Seamless integration 00 Integrate with your existing support tools (Zendesk, Salesforce, etc.), knowledge bases (Slack, Confluence, custom databases, etc.), and third party services (Stripe, Shopify, etc.). Use tools to take action or trigger other workflows. LLM choice 00 Maintain flexibility with a model- agnostic platform. Choose your preferred LLM or use models that our engineers are constantly evaluating for quality, speed, and cost-efficiency. Brand consistency 00 Ensure consistent decision logic, agent behavior, brand voice, and response quality across every channel by using the same underlying knowledge, reasoning, and workflows. Omnichannel support 00 Auto-resolve complex issues 24/7 in any language over any channelâ chat, email, voice, SMS, and even custom surfaces via API. Optimize Get complete insight into and control over your Al agentsâ from visibility into agent logic to pre-launch testing and live response auditing. AI-powered insights 00 All Al agent conversations have built-in analytics, so you can get instant reporting to continuously improve. Identify themes, find anomalies, and filter to the conversations you care about most. Transparent observability 00 Trace every decision with full visibility into how and why an Al agent responded the way it did, whether it called a model, triggered a workflow, or referenced a specific knowledge article. Ask AI 00 Use natural language to dig into valuable customer insights. Decagon's Al analysis agent reads and analyzes conversations in real time, so you can unlock valuable insights across all your conversations. Testing 00 Evaluate updates to Al agents before deploying to production, just like making unit changes to code. Rigorous testing and versioning enables teams to move faster, optimize performance, and deploy with confidence. Watchtower 00 Review, flag, and audit responsesâ before, during, or after delivery. Monitor user sentiment, alert for mentions of fraud or regulated complaints, and enforce guardrails across all conversations. Scale Effortlessly scale to hundreds of AOPs with Al that continuously learns, adapts, safeguards, and integrates across your entire ecosystem.

Adaptive reasoning 00 Combine the power and flexibility of natural language with the precision and rigor of code-based logic to dynamically adapt to unpredictable real-world customer interactions. Enterprise-grade guardrails 00 Ensure critical operations like identity verification and refunds are executed securely with strict controls and validation. Knowledge suggestions 00 Identify gaps in your knowledge base by analyzing conversations where customers didn't get complete answers, and automatically drafts new articles based on how your best human agents resolved those issues.

"Rippling has a very broad surface area with distinct products that require unique treatments â we brought this problem statement to Decagon and they delivered. We are able to tailor the experience and responses to customers to not only deliver strong deflection results, but also enhance the customer experience along the way. We are very happy with our results and are looking forward to partnering further with Decagon." Husam Najib VP, Customer Support 32% increase in deflection Read the case study "Working with Decagon has been nothing short of phenomenal. The team has taken our extremely complicated data and created a tool that allows our customers to seamlessly receive help across our business. Additionally, the team has worked tirelessly to build integrations into our CRM and support setups to make sure we would not have to change any of our current operational workflows. Couldn't recommend them more highly!" Thatcher Foster VP, Client Solutions 75% resolution rate Read the case study âThough we already had a robust Voice of the Customer program and an understanding of customer inquiries we thought we could deflect, we saw 10x higher deflection at launch than we anticipated. And while ticket deflection was our primary goal, Decagon has also allowed us to scale our Chat program to 24/7 while hitting critical CX metrics (e.g., FRT, CSAT) at the same time.â Sarah Vanden Broek Director, CX Operations Strategy and AI Director 95% cost reduction Read the case study The future of customer experience starts here.
