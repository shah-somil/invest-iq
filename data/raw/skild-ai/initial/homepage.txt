Skild.ai Overview Bringing AI into the physical world Most AI today exists solely in cyberspace. Physical reality is far more information rich, and automating physical tasks offers immense returns. We are building AI that will interact with and affect change in the real world. Our Thesis Physical AI should be omni-bodied. An AI that truly understands the physical world should not be limited by robot or task type. At Skild, we believe in tackling the robotics problem in its full generality. We are building a unified, omni-bodied brain to control any robot for any task. To keep us grounded on our journey, we are building robot applications that deliver tangible, real-world value. Security/Inspection Robot Platform The Skild Brain enables robots to navigate unstructured, dangerous environments, freeing humans from the burden of constant, manual inspections. Mobile Manipulation Platform Our AI can execute low-level skills like grasping, handover, and navigation on mobile platforms. These skills are abstracted away using an API call, allowing users to build applications without worrying about details of the unstructured, messy real world. Autonomous Packing Our AI can learn highly precise and dexterous skills. We are using these to automate repetitive tasks.
