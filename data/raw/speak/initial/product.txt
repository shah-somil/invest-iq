Careers - Speak Our Mission To reinvent the way people learn, starting with language. Speak makes language learning apps that help you get real conversational practice without needing a live tutor on the other end. View open roles Our Story We believe that learning a language is one of the most life-changing and life-improving skills a person can acquire. It enables you to connect with new cultures, improve your economic condition, and generally live a richer life. Over 2 billion people are actively learning another language right now, but donât have a good path to success. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help. You need to actually converse with someone. This is why virtually everyone fails unless they have a tutor or immerse themselves in the language theyâreÂ learning. Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered tutor that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to. Traction We've quickly grown to become the #1 English app in our first market, South Korea, and now serve hundreds of thousands of subscribers in over 30 countries Investment We've thoughtfully raised over $150m from leading institutions like Accel, OpenAI Startup Fund, and Founders Fund, and individual investors including Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Lachy Groom. People Team of 130 people across offices in San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Ljubljana, with backgrounds at companies like Meta, Google, Doordash, Block, and Dropbox. Founders Founders have previous exits in the education space, including Flashcards+ (#1 education app, acquired by Chegg).
