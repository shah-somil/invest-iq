Humility We move quickly, pivot when needed, and arenât afraid to admit when we are wrong. We have low egos, donât take things personally, and foster a working environment of mutual respect.

People, people, people. The culture at Vannevar is friendly, patriotic, and humble. We work on some of the hardest problems out there, and make a significant impact on the lives of the users we support. In national security, success often comes down to how quickly and accurately people can act on information. AI is at its best when it augments human judgment - helping operators see patterns sooner, weigh options more clearly, and stay ahead of adversaries.
