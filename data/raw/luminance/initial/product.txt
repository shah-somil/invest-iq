Product Feature Spotlight: Accelerate Negotiations with Luminance’s AI-Powered Checklists Contact Careers Academic Program Blog · 7 April 2025 Product Feature Spotlight: Accelerate Negotiations with Luminance’s AI-Powered Checklists The AI developments keep coming thick and fast here at Luminance! Earlier this year, we introduced ‘AI-Powered Checklists’ helping teams across any business navigate negotiations more quickly, confidently and compliantly than ever before. I speak to legal teams every day, and all too often they’re spending huge amounts of time reviewing and amending routine, repetitive contracts. So much of this work can either be totally automated or heavily augmented with AI, and with the latest developments in our Word Plugin, the entire process is more seamless than ever. So, what are Checklists? Well, Luminance now focuses any negotiation around a businesss core positions, instantly directing attention to the clauses you care about, whether they’re unacceptable, non-standard or missing altogether. Displayed in a clear step-by-step Checklist, users can simply tick off each position as they complete their review, ensuring nothing gets missed. Lumi Summary, Lumi Generate and the AI’s reasoning are now all consolidated by clause in an easy-to-follow workflow. So, for each clause, Luminance will immediately provide you with:  Summary: what’s being proposed.  Reason: why it’s not standard against internal benchmarks.  Mark-Up: suggested alternative language which can be inserted in a click. And that’s not all. If you want more detail, Luminance also provides various mark-up options, including preferred and fallback positions, as well as a clear comparison with what the business has or hasn’t accepted during similar negotiations in the past. Perhaps a new team member isn’t sure how far they can deviate from a standard position. Checklists means they get immediate insight into institutional knowledge, without having to call the General Counsel. What’s more, the analysis is provided on a position level. Having been trained exclusively on legally verified documents, Luminance’s proprietary LLM is able to apply an analysis to legal positions across the entire contract, ensuring any reference – conceptual or explicit – is taken into account, rather than assessing language clause-by-clause. For example, let’s say there’s a Limitation of Liability on page three, and then a reference to Limitation on Liability in the Intellectual Property clause on page five – all of this will be considered. By cross-referencing all information, Luminance provides a holistic summary to ensure users are fully informed when choosing to mark-up language. With Checklists helping users focus time and attention on the clauses that matter, it’s never been easier to bring even the most complex contracts into line with your organisation’s gold standards. A few simple clicks, and it’s ready to return to the counterparty so you can get back to the business.
