Our products use reliable data and technology to help represent people fairly to financial institutions, going beyond traditional credit scores to see the full financial picture. We originally built the company with cross-border credit data to address the needs of people immigrating to the U.S. Now we're building on that foundation, expanding to cash flow underwriting and other innovative approaches to create additional paths to financial access. In short, we're giving credit where credit is due.
