Our APIs are OpenAI compatible allowing you to port your application to SambaNova in minutes. Auto Scaling | Load Balancing | Monitoring | Model Management | Cloud Create | Server Management SambaOrchestrator simplifies managing AI workloads across data centers. Easily monitor and manage model deployments and scale automatically to meet user demand. SambaRack™ is a state-of-the-art system that can be set up easily in data centers to run Al inference workloads. They consume an average of 10 kWh running the largest models like gpt-oss-120b. At the heart of SambaNova's innovation lies the RDU (reconfigurable dataflow unit). With a unique 3-tier memory architecture and dataflow processing, RDU chips are able to achieve much faster inference using a lot less power than other architectures. Complete AI platform that provides a fully integrated end-to-end agentic AI stack – spanning across agents, models, knowledge, and data. Composable AI platform that is open, unifies structured and unstructured data, queries in any environment, and deploys on any AI model. Build or use pre-built AI agents — all with business-aware intelligence. Sovereign AI platform that keeps data secure and governed while business teams query in any environment. IT stays in control, while business teams self-serve AI — and both can focus on what matters. Stay on top of AI trends, data & news Sign Up Hume AI delivers realistic voice AI real-time with SambaNova View Customer Spotlight Build with the best open-source models DeepSeek We support the groundbreaking DeepSeek models, including the 671-billion-parameter DeepSeek-R1, which excels in coding, reasoning, and mathematics at a fraction of the cost of other models. On our SambaNova RDU, DeepSeek-R1 achieves remarkable speeds of up to 200 tokens/second, as measured independently by Artificial Analysis. Llama As a launch partner for Meta's Llama 4 series, we've been at the forefront of open-source AI innovation. SambaNova Cloud was the first platform to support all three variants of Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B, and 405B) with fast inference. We are excited to work with Meta to deliver fast inference on both Scout and Maverick models. OpenAI OpenAI's Whisper model — supported on our SambaNova RDU — has become a cornerstone for audio-based AI applications. By leveraging our platform's fast processing speeds, developers can unlock new use cases in voice-based AI agents to create more immersive experiences.
