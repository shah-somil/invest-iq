About - Tala Skip to content Global Kenya Mexico Philippines India Guatemala Centroamérica Menu About Tala is the leading financial platform for the Global Majority. Why we exist Back in 2011, Tala saw a challenge and an opportunity: billions of people around the world lacked access to traditional financial services, not because they didn’t need them, but because the existing systems weren’t built to include them. Driven by necessity, Tala set out to change that. What we do Tala developed new financial infrastructure—combining the intelligence of a credit bureau, the relationship focus of a bank, and the seamless money movement of a payment platform. By using mobile technology and alternative data, we built fintech that makes financial decisions in seconds and disburses funds in minutes, reaching people who have never had access to credit before. How it's going Since then, Tala has delivered over $7 billion in credit to more than 12 million customers across three continents. With a >90% repayment rate, our data-driven models demonstrate that building financial access at scale can be both sustainable and successful. Recognition Tala is proud to be recognized for our award-winning innovation as well as our company culture. Tala has been named to Fortune’s Impact 20, CNBC’s Disruptor 50 list five years in a row, and Forbes’ Fintech 50 list for nine consecutive years.
