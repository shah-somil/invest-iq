Small changes, big impact The Add Block menu on Pages now shows your most-used blocks first (like driver charts and tables), for quicker access. You can now delete all sidebar elements, except for defaults, to keep your workspace organized. Posted Nov 21, 2025 Column summaries improved for large databases You can now select entire columns in databases, and see accurate totals in the summary bar, even when youâre summing over thousands of rows. Use this to validate data imports and spot-check calculations across your full dataset. New rounding formulas You can now round values using new built-in formulas: r oundDown() and roundUp() . Read more about Runwayâs available functions in our docs . Posted Nov 12, 2025 Travel through Runway with Cmd+K Hereâs whatâs new: Cmd + K now works everywhere Find any driver, instantly, even if itâs: On a different page Off-screen Buried deep in a long scroll Just hit Cmdâ¯+â¯K, type what youâre looking for, and weâll highlight it instantly. Even on pages with hundreds of items. Only current scenario-specific comments in merge modal The scenario merge modal now shows only comments from the current scenario. See just the conversations that matter for the specific changes you're reviewing, so you can focus on what matters before merging. Posted Nov 7, 2025 Sticky date headers inside pages Driver tables on pages now have sticky headers â just like database views. As you scroll, the month header stays pinned to the top, so you always know exactly where you are, even in the longest tables. More intuitive time controls When referencing a point in time or a time range in a formula, you can now type exact values , use smooth drag-and-drop sliders , or even control the range with your keyboard. Build formulas that span from past to future with ease. Small changes, big impact Dimensions now show source info , making it easier to track fields from integrations. You can now bulk-delete dimension attributes in one go. @ mentions that reference a driver value now display with proper formatting. Posted Nov 5, 2025 Introducing: System Health Alerts One broken formula can cascade into dozens of errors throughout your entire model. System Health Alerts now surface errors across your workspace and group them by root cause, so you can fix the actual issue. Click any error to jump straight to the broken driver. Alerts are visible to admins only. More HRIS integration fields now available Pull in bonuses, commissions, and other custom fields from your HRIS. You can now query headcount data with SQL, just like any other data source in Runway. Lattice is now fully supported as an HRIS integration. Rippling integration now includes even more fields. Need help setting up custom fields? Just reach out. Weâve got you. Posted Oct 28, 2025 See your data right away with simpler drill-ins Drilling into a driver now takes just one click. If a driver pulls from a single database, Runway shows you the underlying rows immediately, so you can see exactly where the numbers come from. If a driver pulls from multiple databases, weâll group by source to keep things clear. Small changes, big impact Format values as multiples , showing 10.0x instead of 10.0 . Time period comparison charts pull the right date range automatically. No manual tweaks required. Large number abbreviations now display properly in comparison charts. Posted Oct 24, 2025 Leave comments in Runway Keep context exactly where decisions get made. You can now leave comments directly on driver cells, variances, and assumptions. Need to explain seasonality? Question a revenue spike? Flag a headcount assumption? Leave a comment, tag a teammate, and move onâyour thinking is saved. Built for finance workflows Budget vs. Actuals: Add notes right on the variance cells to explain deviations from plan. Time period comparisons: Explain why drivers changed between periods.. Forecasting: Log assumptions as you go, so anyone reviewing the model sees your logic. Month-end close: Flag items for review, tag your teammates, and track issue resolution without leaving Runway. How it works Right-click any cell in Runway to add a comment. Use Â @ mentions to notify teammatesâtheyâll get an instant in-app ping. Comments support rich text formatting, and are timestamped for audit trails. Hover to preview, click to expand, and resolve when done. Comments persist across scenarios. They're visible in draft scenarios, and they follow your work when merged to Main. All open threads appear in the comment menu. Comments respect permission levels. Admins can delete any comment. Available now for all Runway users. Posted Oct 10, 2025 Model invoice data directly in Runway You can now sync QuickBooks Online invoices into Runway, and query against the data set. Bring in both outgoing invoices (expenses) and outstanding receivables (revenue yet to be collected). Track unpaid invoices alongside cash flow. Build richer revenue and cash flow models using real invoice data. Small changes, big impact Formulas now accept double quotes ( " ) as well as single quotes ( ' ) for strings, so writing dates like "2025-01-01" just works. The Plans page now uses the same powerful driver search menu as the driver grid. Search by model, database, or attribute. The formula editor now auto-resizes , letting you view long formulas without clicking in. Formulas expand to full cell width, and wrap cleanly across multiple lines. CSV exports from the driver grid now include the description column . Variance column values now inherit the precision of their drivers. Hover to see full precision in a tooltip. Posted Oct 3, 2025 A new way to model changing dimensions Some elements in your model depend on categories that change over timeâlike title, level, or office in headcount planning. To stay accurate, your model needs to evolve with those shifts. Dimension Drivers make that easy. They let you derive dynamic tags using formulas, making dimensions as powerful as numeric or date drivers. One formula on a Dimension Driver can now handle complex, multi-key lookups. Instead of endless IF statements or manual tagging, you can automatically map combinations of dimensions into the right category. Itâs perfect for mapping multiple dimensions into a single output (e.g. Department + Region = Budget Group ), which automatically re-categorizes your data ( CX in England = Team Abroad; CX in US = US Team ). Youâll find it in databases under: Add Property(+) â Advanced â Dimension Driver Posted Oct 2, 2025 Smarter data propagation, simpler Activity History Hereâs whatâs new: New time range propagate options Two new options in the time range selector make it easier to work with sparse or missing data: Next available value: looks forward in time to fill gaps. Most recent value: looks backward , and if nothing is found, forward to the first non-null. Use these for things like CRM deals (propagate a closed dealâs value forward) or HRIS data (backfill employee start dates). Theyâre available in both the datashaping UI and the formula editor. Simpler Activity History The Activity History now filters out background syncs and automated Runway actions by default. That means youâll just see the edits made by you and your team. You can still toggle Runwayâs automated actions back on if you need them. Small changes, big impact Variance columns on by default: Add a comparison view, and now variance value and variance % columns appear by default. No extra toggles needed. Fiscal year rollups that match your reporting needs: Quarterly and annual rollup labels will align with your chosen fiscal year start month (March instead of January, for example). This makes reporting consistent with a fiscal year offset. Posted Sep 25, 2025 Exports, comparisons, and cleaner pages A set of upgrades that make Runway easier to share, present, and fine-tune. Block names in CSV exports CSV downloads now include the block name in the file name , so every export is instantly recognizable. Especially useful when working with multiple blocks at once. Time period comparisons in charts See how a driver compares to itself in different periods. Add comparisons to any time series chart. Choose rollups like 3 months ago , Â 12 months ago , or Â 4 years ago . Layer multiple time-period comparisons for richer historical context. Small changes, big impact Use a divider to separate sections on pages . Just type -- in a text block and hit Enter . Time period ticks now appear on small and medium chart x-axes, making timelines easier to scan. Combo and side-by-side charts now share the same height, so they align cleanly. You can now reorder drivers in combo charts directly from the 6-dot menu in the settings menu on the stacked bar chart. Posted Sep 19, 2025 Better comparisons, smoother drill-ins Zero rows grouped at the bottom of drill-ins Drill-ins are now easier to scan. Rows that contain only zeros automatically drop to the bottom, so the drivers with values set for the time-period are always front and center. If you enter a value in a previously zeroed-out row, it will jump back up to the top. Smarter variance calculations Variance columns now treat missing or NULL drivers as 0 . This means drill-in variance rows add up cleanly to the total variance for the driver. Drill-in limits to keep things smooth Drill-ins show every input behind a driver. Like contracts that feed revenue, or vendor spend driving marketing expense. To keep things fast: Runway now displays the first 15 rows by default. A âShow all rowsâ button expands the rest when you need them. The row limit is configurable for your organization or individual users. Just reach out if youâd like us to adjust them.
