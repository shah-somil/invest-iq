In many organizations, it is a multi-month mission involving many departments. It results in an unpleasant administrative experience across all companies trying to pay each other. Candex was founded in 2011 by Jeremy Lappin and Shani Vaza to solve the tail spend problem. Their technology removes thousands of vendor records from financial systems while delivering control, speed, tax compliance, and visibility. Great design and attention to detail makes Candex the simplest and most precise way to get tail spend under control.
