The depositor may exclude banks from eligibility to receive its funds.

Although deposits are placed in increments that do not exceed the FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount (âSMDIAâ) at any one bank, a depositorâs balances at the institution that places deposits may exceed the SMDIA before settlement for deposits or after settlement for withdrawals. The depositor must determine whether placement through an IntraFi service satisfies any restrictions on its deposits.
