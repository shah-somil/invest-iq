The backstory Like most successful ideas, True Link was founded to solve a clear and immediate problem. When the lifestyle of a beloved, aging grandmother was threatened by the risks of financial abuse, fraud, and scams, company co-founder Kai Stinchcombe set out to find a solution. The card succeeded in providing the protections his grandmother needed and the increased independence he and his family wished for her. Since then, True Link has worked to expand and build upon the concept of adaptive financial products and services We have evolved our offerings to meet the needs of a broader set of people with complex needs and those who care for them. This includes people in recovery, people with disabilities and their caregivers â from family members to attorneys to recovery centers.
